# Harris Corner Detection - OpenCV | TA Assignment 2

## üìå Project Description

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates **Harris Corner Detection** ‚Äî a foundational technique in computer vision used to identify corners within an image. Corners are critical features in many vision tasks such as object recognition and image matching. The notebook utilizes **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** for image processing and visualization. This work is part of a Teaching Assistant (TA) assignment under a Computer Vision curriculum.
